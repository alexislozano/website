Hi people of the Internet, it's been a long time! The truth is, since I joined [360Learning](https://360learning.com/), I did not have so much time to write. No, I would not be honest saying that. I really did not have any ideas of what to write about. And you know what, I have new ideas! So today, let's talk about my desire to build side projects.

## A first foot in freedom

When I was in college, I wanted to work on projects that would interest me. No more boring school projects, but nice projects with end-users and team work. As a long-time linux fan and computer related stuff tinkerer, I wanted to work on open source projects. But actually, I never did that. Why, you would ask? Because everything appeared to me like big projects with a lot of people, a lot of already written code, and I did not have any idea of where to begin.

Two years before graduation though, I got an email (or maybe I heard someone talk anout this, not really sure anymore) where something called Les Entrepreneuriales was described. It was kind of a program to learn about entrepreneurship. I got hooked on that, and with the help of a great friend (Enzo, I you read this, thanks for teaming up with me), I worked on a simple video game as an MVP for the final round of the competition. We ranked 4th, and we were very happy about it!

## Winter in London

Fast forward to the end of college. I had a six month internship to do. I wanted to work in a foreign country (did I mention that I am French?) and I went to London, England. There, I worked for a small startup aimed at restaurateurs. They were great times. Tough code wise but I learned a lot. Hard language wise but I leaned a lot too. And we got snow. After that, I went to the United States for a six month exchange and came back having graduated. I worked in different companies and I am now working at my present gig.

## Kobumi and my own code

Okay, actually I did not tell one thing. During the autumn and winter before coming at 360Learning, I wanted to taste for real the sweet pleasure of creating something from scratch. I wanted to start my own company, Kobumi. Thirsty for adventure, my eyes facing the sun, I was ready to fight and create and overcome the difficulties. You know what? It did not work out. Blinded by the product I wanted to create, I did not think about product market fit. And, same as before: You know what? Six months after the beginning, I lost my motivation. But now, this is the past. And I think I have learnt a lot of things with this. First, I need to reach out potential clients before writing a single line of code. I need to figure out what are their pain points, and how I could help them. Second, I need to be sure I have a market, and when I say market I mean clients who want to pay. To do that, I intend to create landing pages for my future products with a form to pay, even if the product does not exist and I refund the money. The key is this: be sure that someone wants your product and wants to pay you for it.

## Listening of the voices of the ancients

During the last weeks, I read a lot about side projects and indie entrepreneurship. Making thing small and simple. Bootstrapping. Trying things and correct them after. I want to go on that path and see what could come. If you are interested, here are some sources:

- [indiehackers](https://indiehackers.com): international community
- [indiemakers](https://indiemakers.fr): french podcast
- [artisan d√©veloppeur](https://artisandeveloppeur.fr): french blog & podcast
- [alex west](https://alexwest.co): indie hacker
- [tinyprojects](https://tinyprojects.dev): indie hacker

So I don't have a big idea right now, but I think it's fine. Because I don't need to make big projects. I just need to work on small things that I like. If something comes up for my thinking, I'll try to talk about it here, so stay tuned! Or maybe not, I don't want to commit to something for now :p
