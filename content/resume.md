# Alexis Lozano - Software Engineer

## About me

My name is Alexis Lozano. I am a software engineer living in Nantes, France. I love to code and read about coding. I am fluent in French and English, and I am pretty confident in my skills on Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. In my spare time, I like to read, play video games and cross-stitch pixel art. Oh, and I cook delicious waffles.
